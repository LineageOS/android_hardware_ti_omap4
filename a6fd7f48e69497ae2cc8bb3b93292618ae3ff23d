      "message": "Sure, I can see your point, but moving this flag here makes sense for OMAP4:\n- There was a recent push to commonize more into h/ti/omap4\n- Current behavior is not changed, but made more flexible\n- Although it doesn\u0027t make a difference now, with a newer DDK, we\u0027d need to remove this kludge (that\u0027s how I stumbled upon this).\n\nAs of now, f/native has both the board flag and the OMAP4 hardcoding. OMAP4 devices that don\u0027t use h/ti/omap4 (can\u0027t think of any, hopefully a minority), should use the flag.",
